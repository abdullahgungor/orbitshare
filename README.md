OrbitShare is a sustainable platform developed by IUA Space Team to commercialize Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by repurposing existing satellites for new missions. The platform allows satellite owners to lease their unused operational satellites to researchers, universities, or small teams for short-term missions.
